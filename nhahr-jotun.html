                            <p> I know it’s powerful frames (possibly only at bergusia), but what’s your experience with drop rates? I have all 6 ballistics for this week, but won’t be home til tomorrow. Please advise. Thank. In the triumphs for Black Armory, there’s a triumph that says get kills with Jotun in at the Volundr Forge. Other ones say stuff like get kills with izanagi’s burden at izanami forge so each weapon corresponds to a forge, and that exotic quest from Volundr probably turns into Jotun. Still grinding for that sucker and no drops. Gun is nuts. Plus Mega Man FPS fantasy. Does anyone have any suggestions for a Jotun CB build? I am thinking that a similar build to Kael might work with speed accuracy and atk, with his burn being 
Hi Everyone, I'm back with a Clan Boss guide! In this guide I'm going to cover the basics of clan boss team building. No two clan boss teams will be identical, what's important is identifying champions who can fulfill the roles you need! Clan Boss building can be counter-intuitive because it's built different than nearly every other challenge in the game. In every dungeon, campaign, and arena your goal is simple: kill the enemy. In clan boss, your goal is different. I think that it's far more frustrating to deal with a taken captain who teleports every second, throws blinding orbs and has a shield than a Taken Knight who kinda just wanders around and absorbs damage. The only thing the Taken Knight has going for them is their fire that they spew out at the player that does a lot of damage, but other than that they're just a big sponge that sits there. Compared to the captain which as a decent amount of health, which doesn't even matter when you can't Thank you for the free 7 enhancement cores I guess. Any strats, weapons or anything that I can use to easily get massacre medals? We're so focused on his godhood we sometimes forget Kratos is an expert strategist who was a general! Kratos was a Spartan General and leader of armies. He is now much older and wise, and has a lifetime of war. Odin is a master strategist, and shares the mantle of God of War with Tyr and Thor. He is very wise and lives for strategy, planning and scheming. How cool would it be, if Kratos vs Odin isn't single combat I have been a merciless user since season 1, i have always loved how it feels and the damage, but ever since telesto and jotun came in, its like merciless has been underappreciated, i would love to see either 1. Charge time decrease to 800-850 as telesto is 780 and jotun is 860. 2. Increse damage to 55 (like it was in season 1/2) or so I know that merciless is a truck on PvE but i think for PvP standards is kind of sub par (in season 6 terms) I also know impertus (or however you spell RNG has not been my friend as far as the Forges are concerned. I only run one character, but every week since Bergusia opened I ran my two powerful frames. I would save up my completed daily bounties so as soon as reset hit I could immediately get my first ballistics log. After every run I would die a little inside, as time after time I failed to hit the RNG lottery. I thought I got lucky once when during a match I spotted an exotic engram hiding behind a pillar, but it ended up being Trinity. 
Early on in the most recent game Kratos mentions how some place is built rather small for giants. Atreus returns “giants are just another race of people!” and implies that the regular sized structures are common. Fey was a giant, and she is presumed to be average size. Atreus is a giant and he is also average. The hall you go through seems average size, and the mural on the wall couldn’t have been made by megolodon sized fellas. But when you go to spread Fey’s ashes, you see hundreds of gigantic. Auto attack based hunters especially. It feels like their damage doesn't have to be respected for the majority of the game. Even endgame most of the time. I'm currently floating diamond 4 mmr and I cant remember a game where a hunter lead the board in damage this season. Meanwhile auto mages can top the charts no problem. Hunter is my weakest role now and I'm hoping someone could shed some light on something I've missed. P.S. Wtf is Arthur still doing Hello everyone, I am just looking to see which champs you all recommend for your Clan Boss (CB) team and why? Just trying to gear some more knowledge for myself. </p>
